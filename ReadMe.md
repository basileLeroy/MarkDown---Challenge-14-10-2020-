### You can ALWAYS count on me when...

...Help is needed, I am a very social guy that likes to help out when I can. Don't be afraid to approach me with a question or something else entirely (yes, I am single!)
I will also honestly tell when I don't know something, so maybe in those cases we can look for the answer together?

### A funny story:

I was once in a car accident where my leg was severely wounded... although that part may not exactly be funny, the next one is... In the ambulance, They started cutting my (newly bought) pants to schreads as to be able to get to my wound. I woke up during that and was pretty dishoriented and the first thing i thought was: **"OH NO THEY DIDN'T!"** And started yelling at them because I just bought them and they were expensive too.. as they started to explain the situation I was in, I tried calling the cops for assault.. and one paramedic started laughing frantically..

#### TL;DR

Don't wear new pants if you are planning of beeing in a car accident.. they will be destroyed!
